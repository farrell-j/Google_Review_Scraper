Starbucks,5,"3699 McKinney Ave, Dallas, TX 75204, USA",Pepe Ruiz,"The place has great sitting spaces. The couches seemed new and made of quality leather. It was a step above most starbucks in terms of the furniture and decor. The bathroom wasn't thebsame vibe, but it balances out. I loved my cold brew in a hot day.",5
Starbucks,5,"3699 McKinney Ave, Dallas, TX 75204, USA",D. Savita Harris,"Probably my favorite Starbucks, ever, primarily because of the outstanding design. It's super extremely spacious yet somehow still cozy, with a little area tucked away in the back if you're craving a little extra privacy. There's ample and diverse seating, and huge floor to ceiling windows line two walls, letting in plenty of light. However, because the street outside is shady, it isn't too sunny either in summer. There's outdoor seating as well. It seems like there's always parking right by the door, but if not, free garage parking is only yards away.",5
Starbucks,5,"3699 McKinney Ave, Dallas, TX 75204, USA",Daniel Puckett,"What a spacious and welcoming Starbucks! I imagine you’ve been to dozens of other corner locations, but this one is truly different. The interior feels like a monument to what all Starbucks try to be. The service is professional and fast. The options are well stocked and presented. The space is clean, well lit, and spacious.",5
Starbucks,5,"3699 McKinney Ave, Dallas, TX 75204, USA",Tye Edwards,"I am pretty sure this is one of the fastest Starbucks I have ever been to. I can appreciate this because I used to order cups at Starbucks before work at different locations and I would usually have to wait. I hardly ever wait here, even when it’s busy. I think I had to wait once and that was a timing issue on my behalf and during off hours it always says like 3 or 4 minutes and it’s always true.",5
Starbucks,4,"3699 McKinney Ave, Dallas, TX 75204, USA",Claire Hernandez,Pretty good location as far as service and drinks. Cleanliness is pretty bad. Floors dirty and tables always sticky. The bathrooms look like a run down gas station. They are so dirty.,4
